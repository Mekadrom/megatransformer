# MegaTransformer

## Overview
MegaTransformer is a highly customizable transformer module in one package. Given a yaml config, a transformer model is constructed according to specific parameters.

Again, the benefit of using this over the builtin module in PyTorch is that this is highly configurable with the most modern implementations and can be easily modified to suit your needs.

## Installation
To install MegaTransformer, follow these steps:
`pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ megatransformer`

## Usage
To train using deepspeed with ZeRO-2 (best compatibility and performance trade-off), use the following command:
```bash
deepspeed --num_gpus=2 train.py \
    --use_deepspeed \
    --bf16 \
    --run_name my_run_name \
    --config modern \
    --deepspeed_config ds_config_zero-2.json
```
